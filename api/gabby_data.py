At 22inches, it takes up a fair amount of space on your desktop, but it is not overwhelming, and at under $300, the price is close to the generic competition. I spent quite a bit of time researching and comparing LCD monitors, and HP clearly is a cut above for roughly the same money. This monitor is more attractive visually, and its adjustability up and down, and 90 degree rotation option may be of importance to many consumers. I opened the box, hooked it up, installed the software, and haven't touched anything since. This model and similar HP monitors are some of the best deals out there for a desktop user who believes that it is worth paying a few dollars more for a clearly superior product.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/HP-W2207H-22-inch-Widescreen-LCD-Monitor\/dp\/B00139S3U6\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">HP W2207H 22-inch Widescreen LCD Monitor<\/a>","reviewTitle":"HP Monitor Beats The Competition","reviewTime":1229731200000,"phrase":[None,None],"n_matches":2},{"review_id":173319,"rating":3.0,"sentiment":"negative","vote":5.0,"verified":True,"reviewerID":"A1WT047CVF256C","asin":"B001LYPNFQ","reviewText":"Overall a nice monitor. Yes, it has tint problems out of the box, but you should calibrate every monitor you get anyway, regardless of quality. It can make a huge difference, even if you're not editing photos or the like. Calibration solves the monitor's blue tint problem completely, so it would seem to simply be a matter of poorly selected defaults at the factory.\n\nI only have two complaints. The first is a simple problem that Asus simply should not have overlooked. The monitor has no height adjustment, and the stand is pretty short. If you set it on a desk with proper height adjustment for your arms, the screen will likely be too low for you. I put mine on a nice solid mounting arm to solve the problem. The second is more serious, and concerns the picture quality. I am driving my monitor from a brand new Mac Mini through the HDMI port, and there seem to be color bleed issues. The edge of bright colors should be sharp and crisp, but the left and right edges bleed over noticeably, at a darker color level, yielding what looks like a sort of faint line on the edge. I have the screen in native 1920x1200 mode, so there really shouldn't be any antialiasing issues or somesuch. In any case, none of the other monitors I've used with the mac (3 others today) have this problem. This seems to happen more with certain colors than others, and does appear to depend on the background to some extent. Bright reds and greens are the worst, bleeding over a couple of pixels, but other darker colors don't seem as bad. This could be due to the fact that I'm using HDMI instead of DVI, but since I run dual-headed (and my other permanent monitor doesn't have HDMI), I have little choice.\n\nBecause of the color bleed issue, I would not recommend this monitor for things like photo\/video editing, or anything that requires clean, sharp lines. But as a monitor for everyday browsing, document editing, and probably games (this is for work, so I won't be trying out any games on it), it should be fine. The price is right, at least.","reviewTitle":"I would give 3.5 stars if it were possible","reviewTime":1288656000000,"phrase":[None,None,None],"n_matches":3},{"review_id":209586,"rating":5.0,"sentiment":"positive","vote":12.0,"verified":False,"reviewerID":"A25A7C826KIX2R","asin":"B002MT6SDU","reviewText":"I bought this to replace an older 4:3 Princeton LCD.  Worked fine right out of the box with my Lenovo T61 laptop and its built in NVidia graphics card.  My previous experience with 15-17\" widescreens was poor because they had a much smaller effective screen height than 4:3 which resulted in very small text and graphics for a given screen size.  For example, my 15.4' laptop widescreen is very difficult to view with the native resolution of 1920x1080.  The 25\" diagonal width worked out to be about the same height as my 4:3 LCD which is what I wanted: I didn't want to lose any screen height.  I was concerned that the resolution might be too small to read but it worked out about the same.  My 19\" LCD 4:3 displayed 1280x1024 and this HP displays 1920x1080 so the text and icons are about the same size.  I use this for business purposes so the widescreen format wasn't important but having the extra screen width with the same height as the monitor I was replacing was important for viewing multiple windows side by side.  I wound up buying a Planar dual display mount and have the older monitor and the HP side by side in dual display mode.  The Lenovo T61 NVidea card is capable of dual monitor displays.  I have PLENTY of workspace now and although it looks a little odd with a 4:3 next to the widescreen, it works well for me.\n\nThis HP monitor has VGA, DVI and HDMI ports and it comes with one of each cable in the box.  The stand is a little flimsy and the monitor will wiggle if bumped.  As I stated above, I took the stand off and use the Planar dual mount which is very rigid.  As for the screen, the monitor has excellent contrast and color.  Yes - The screen is a little shiny and has a little reflection but it is no worse than CRT's and I think this shiny front gives the monitor the rich colors and excellent contrast. I use this in a very bright office with lots of sun and have no problems.  You might have some issues if light is behind you though.\n\nCan't go wrong with this one.  I noticed the price has gone up.  I paid $279 for mine before Xmas and now it is up to $297 but still worth it for this size, quality and name brand.","reviewTitle":"Excellent Monitor","reviewTime":1262044800000,"phrase":[None,None,None],"n_matches":3},{"review_id":227216,"rating":5.0,"sentiment":"positive","vote":0.0,"verified":True,"reviewerID":"A3NM39O6R8H3A5","asin":"B0039648BO","reviewText":"I'm going to start this review of with what I feel are this monitors shortcomings, because there really aren't that many of them.\nAlso keep in mind that, my opinion of a pro or con, feature wise, may be reversed for someone else. It's all based on personal preference really. I'll attempt to be as objective as possible.\nCONS\nFirst and foremost..\nI. Price. quality doesn't come cheap and the Dell U2711 is no exception. I have been considering a Dell U3011 for sometime now, but the price always turned me away, and the U2711 wasn't significantly cheaper. However I just happened to come across this monitor again the other day for $650. My response? Shut up and take my money. The cheapest I've ever seen a brand new one was about $900. I hope these continue to get cheaper because I would like to buy at least two more in the future.\nII. Size. 27 inches is bigger than the average desktop monitor, but the U2711 is a monster and it's heavy too. The FED EX driver was quick to comment on that. I don't really consider this much of a con though. I like my computer hardware to be sturdy and well built. If you plan to mount this beast you will want to buy a very good mount.\nIII. ghosting and response time. My last monitor was a 27 inch samsung syncmaster. I'm not really noticing much of a difference in the response times. 1ms response time vs 6ms is almost None. I do believe there is a bit of ghosting in gaming. This may be a deal breaker for FPS players. I will need more time to play different games to really test this. So far I have only played Skyrim and it seems perfectly fine.\nIV. Anti-glare. The anti-glare coating is only noticeable on whites for the most part. It doesn't bother me. I actually kind of like it.\nPROS\nI. Resolution. The main reason I bought this monitor. I wanted to game at 1440p. It's even better than I thought it would be. You will never want to go back to 1080p.\nII. Color. This wasn't really something I thought I would care that much about. My Samsung monitor had great color, but this thing blows it out of the water. going from 16.7 million to 1.07 BILLION is night and day. I can see why a photographer would love this monitor.\nIII. Inputs. I've never seen so many inputs on a monitor. I especially like the USB and SD card slots. Though someone should probably tell Dell that VGA cables are no longer the standard. Out of the box, a VGA cable was plugged into the back. Maybe they're just trying to get rid of them? I digress. I was happy to see that it did come with cables, even a display port cable was included. A premium monitor should come with all the accessories. thank you Dell.\nIV. Controls. Best controls ever. Seriously, every monitor I've owned has had terrible controls. Switching between different presets and changing brightness is very easy.\nV. Housing and Stand. This is a professional monitor and it definitely shows. It's not glossy or gimmicky. There were no annoying stickers all over the monitor. I love the stand on this monitor. It doesn't feel like it may break in 6 months. It's built to last. It also slides up and down, which is my favorite feature, and left and right. Overall the housing is very plain. The minimalist will love this. I know I do.\nVI. Packaging. The U2711 came in very good packaging. I was impressed.\n\nFinal thoughts\nThere's very little reason not to buy this monitor. In the future I may regret not going with the U3011, but the price was so much lower on the U2711 at the time so the choice was obvious. If it comes down to it and the price difference becomes less than about $200, then go with the U3011. One other reason not to buy this monitor would be whether your system can handle the resolution. Skyrim runs at about 30-40FPS on my system. Though it may run higher if I didn't have 20 or so graphics mods installed.\nHere are my specs so you can have some sort of idea what you will need.\n\nCPU: Intel Core I5 2500k @ 4Ghz\nRAM: 16gb Corsair Vengeance 1600Mhz\nMotherboard: Gigabyte Z68\nVideo Card: MSI Radeon 7950 with arctic accellero 7970 cooler\nSSD: Samsung 840 pro 256GB\nHDD: Standard issue 1TB\nPSU thermaltake 850 watt modular.\n\nYou can probably get by on lesser specs, but you will take a performance hit. 2560x1440=3,686,400 total pixels, 1920x1080=2,073,600. That's almost %60 more pixels your computer will have to process. 1080p pushes a lot of PC's to their limits as it is.\n\nI recommend buying new as well. Supposedly some of the earlier models had problems.\nI hope this has been informative\nCheers!","reviewTitle":"Best purchase I have made this year","reviewTime":1354060800000,"phrase":[None,None,None],"n_matches":3},{"review_id":222049,"rating":5.0,"sentiment":"positive","vote":0.0,"verified":True,"reviewerID":"A3376ZXV304DQV","asin":"B002ZVCGXQ","reviewText":"This has to be the best monitor you can buy for the price.\n\nPros:\nPrice - for under two hundred, a bargain.\nQuality - the best monitor I've ever owned.

Also the monitor produces no heat.\nWeight - can easily lift and probably the lightest monitor you can own for a comparable size.\nScreen - full HD quality 1920x1080. I have it plugged in to a ATI HD5850 and games and movies play great.\nTouch buttons - great response time and look nice.\n\nCons: (The cons below don't even come close to knocking off a star from this rating of 5 stars. I just listed as an FYI)\nStand - the monitor always has a tilt because of the stand design. The quickest and most effective way I found to fix this was put something under the stand which solves that problem.\nAC\/DC coveter - way hotter than it should be.

Combined with a 3 year limited warranty, an industry best pixel performance policy and Windows 7 certification, the VX2250wm-LED is a great long term investment for any display user.<br\/> <table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\"> <tr> <td width=\"75%\">  <b>Key Features:<\/b> <b>What is a LED monitor? <\/b><br> The term &ldquo;LED monitor&rdquo; generally refers to a monitor with a LCD panel and a LED backlight. A typical LCD monitor uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFL) as a light source to illuminate the LCD panel. In an LED backlight monitor, white LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) are used as the light source. LED backlights provide the following benefits: <img src=\"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/G\/01\/electronics\/detail-page\/B003HFCDLY_CCFL.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"201\"> <img src=\"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/G\/01\/electronics\/detail-page\/B003HFCDLY_LED_image.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"201\"> <img src=\"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/G\/01\/electronics\/detail-page\/B003HFCDLY_Blub.jpg\" width=\"172\" height=\"229\"> <img src=\"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/G\/01\/electronics\/detail-page\/B003HFCDLY_Energy_savings.jpg\" width=\"362\" height=\"360\"> <b>MEGA dynamic contrast ratio <\/b><br> One of the great features of VX2250wm-LED is its ability to dim the backlight completely for pure darkness during dark scenes such as a night shot in a movie. Contrast ratios refer to the ratio of the brightest color to the darkest color. With traditional CCFL backlit displays, contrast ratios are limited to the fluorescent lamp&rsquo;s ability to dim in order to reproduce darkness. However, with the LED backlight, each LED has the ability to completely shut off allowing for a near infinite ratio of black to white contrast. The end result is true blacks that result in greater overall image quality. <b>Pair it with a ViewSonic or Mac computer<\/b><br> One of the key advantages of the VX2250wm-LED monitor is its diverse connectivity options, making it flexible to be paired with a PC or a Mac computer. ViewSonic has recently announced a full line of PC products, including notebooks, netbooks, PC Minis and all-in-one PCs. Now you can hook up a Viewsonic ViewBook notebook or a PC Mini as well as a MacBook or a Mac Mini to the VX2250wm-LED and enjoy a full 22\" (21.5\" Vis) widescreen with LED backlight! <table width=\"750\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"> <tr> <td width=\"250\"><div align=\"center\"> <img src=\"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/G\/01\/electronics\/detail-page\/B003HFCDLY_VNB131_hero.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"136\"> <em><strong>ViewSonic ViewBook VNB131 <\/strong><\/em> <img src=\"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/G\/01\/electronics\/detail-page\/B003HFCDLY_PCMini.jpg\" width=\"124\" height=\"136\"> <em><strong>ViewSonic PC Mini VOT120 <\/strong><\/em> <img src=\"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/G\/01\/electronics\/detail-page\/B003HFCDLY_MacMini.jpg\" width=\"168\" height=\"136\"> <em><strong>Apple Mac Mini <\/strong><\/em> <strong>VESA mountable <\/strong><br> The VX2250wm-LED features a 100mm x 100mm VESA mountable design that allows you to mount it on a monitor stand or on a wall, depending on your specific needs.

You can select one of the &ldquo;Optimize&rdquo; or &ldquo;Conserve&rdquo; options and save up to 35% energy. Especially under low ambient light conditions, adjusting the brightness will improve visibility by reducing eye fatigue. Reducing brightness will also prolong the monitor&rsquo;s lamp life, improving your return on investment. <b>The best pixel performance guarantee and 3 year warranty<\/b><br> One of the aspects that makes ViewSonic a market leader in displays is its commitment to quality.
