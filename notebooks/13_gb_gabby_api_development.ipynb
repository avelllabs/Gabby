A typical LCD monitor uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFL) as a light source to illuminate the LCD panel. In an LED backlight monitor, white LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) are used as the light source. LED backlights provide the following benefits: <img src=\\\\\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/B003HFCDLY_CCFL.jpg\\\\\" width=\\\\\"250\\\\\" height=\\\\\"201\\\\\"> <img src=\\\\\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/B003HFCDLY_LED_image.jpg\\\\\" width=\\\\\"250\\\\\" height=\\\\\"201\\\\\"> <img src=\\\\\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/B003HFCDLY_Blub.jpg\\\\\" width=\\\\\"172\\\\\" height=\\\\\"229\\\\\"> <img src=\\\\\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/B003HFCDLY_Energy_savings.jpg\\\\\" width=\\\\\"362\\\\\" height=\\\\\"360\\\\\"> <b>MEGA dynamic contrast ratio </b><br> One of the great features of VX2250wm-LED is its ability to dim the backlight completely for pure darkness during dark scenes such as a night shot in a movie. Contrast ratios refer to the ratio of the brightest color to the darkest color. With traditional CCFL backlit displays, contrast ratios are limited to the fluorescent lamp&rsquo;s ability to dim in order to reproduce darkness. However, with the LED backlight, each LED has the ability to completely shut off allowing for a near infinite ratio of black to white contrast. The end result is true blacks that result in greater overall image quality. <b>Pair it with a ViewSonic or Mac computer</b><br> One of the key advantages of the VX2250wm-LED monitor is its diverse connectivity options, making it flexible to be paired with a PC or a Mac computer. ViewSonic has recently announced a full line of PC products, including notebooks, netbooks, PC Minis and all-in-one PCs. Now you can hook up a Viewsonic ViewBook notebook or a PC Mini as well as a MacBook or a Mac Mini to the VX2250wm-LED and enjoy a full 22\\\\\" (21.5\\\\\" Vis) widescreen with LED backlight! <table width=\\\\\"750\\\\\" border=\\\\\"0\\\\\" cellspacing=\\\\\"0\\\\\" cellpadding=\\\\\"0\\\\\"> <tr> <td width=\\\\\"250\\\\\"><div align=\\\\\"center\\\\\"> <img src=\\\\\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/B003HFCDLY_VNB131_hero.jpg\\\\\" width=\\\\\"180\\\\\" height=\\\\\"136\\\\\"> <em><strong>ViewSonic ViewBook VNB131 </strong></em> <img src=\\\\\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/B003HFCDLY_PCMini.jpg\\\\\" width=\\\\\"124\\\\\" height=\\\\\"136\\\\\"> <em><strong>ViewSonic PC Mini VOT120 </strong></em> <img src=\\\\\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/B003HFCDLY_MacMini.jpg\\\\\" width=\\\\\"168\\\\\" height=\\\\\"136\\\\\"> <em><strong>Apple Mac Mini </strong></em> <strong>VESA mountable </strong><br> The VX2250wm-LED features a 100mm x 100mm VESA mountable design that allows you to mount it on a monitor stand or on a wall, depending on your specific needs.

When you don&rsquo;t need all of the powerful features the VX2250wm-LED has to offer, you have the option to reduce the monitor&rsquo;s brightness, save energy, and prolong the lamp life. You can select one of the &ldquo;Optimize&rdquo; or &ldquo;Conserve&rdquo; options and save up to 35% energy. Especially under low ambient light conditions, adjusting the brightness will improve visibility by reducing eye fatigue. Reducing brightness will also prolong the monitor&rsquo;s lamp life, improving your return on investment. <b>The best pixel performance guarantee and 3 year warranty</b><br> One of the aspects that makes ViewSonic a market leader in displays is its commitment to quality. ViewSonic is committed to using the highest grade panels and offer the best pixel performance policy in the market.
